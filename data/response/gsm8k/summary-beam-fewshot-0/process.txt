Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>Let x be the original price of the jogger jeans.

Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, the tattered jeans cost x + $6.

Cole saved a total of $6, so the total cost of both jeans is x + (x + $6) = 2x + $6.

He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is 1/3 * $6 = $2. So, the cost of the jogger jeans after savings is x - $2.

The cost of the tattered jeans after savings is (x + $6) - ($2) = x + $4.

Since the total savings was $6, we have the equation (2x + $6) - (x - $2 + x + $4) = $6
Simplify the equation: 2x + $6 - 2x - $6 = $6
0 = $6.

There seems to be a mistake in the calculations. Let's double-check the mathematical operations and the relationships between the components.</E>
