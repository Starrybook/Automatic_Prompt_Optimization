>>> Prompt: Given the information provided in the input data, break down the calculation of total cost and total revenue into separate steps, focusing on individual units before summing up for the total. Clearly identify the key elements involved such as the number of items, cost per item, and selling price per item. Make sure to calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of items by the cost per item, and the total revenue by multiplying the number of items by the selling price per item. Document each step of the calculations and provide a clear explanation for each calculation to ensure precise arithmetic operations are performed. Aim to determine the profit earned by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
