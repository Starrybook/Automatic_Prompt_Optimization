Error in parse_target_model_output: To calculate how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we need to first find out how many miles she will cover in total by walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles covered in a day:
125 miles x 2 = 250 miles/day

Step 2: Calculate the total miles covered in a month:
250 miles/day x 30 days = 7500 miles/month

Step 3: Find out how many more miles Soledad must hike per day to complete her journey on time:
9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles

Step 4: Calculate the additional miles per day:
1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.
