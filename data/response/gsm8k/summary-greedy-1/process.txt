Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>John's research extended for 5 months, which were initially funded with $100,000. The additional months experienced a 50% increase in funding requirement per month. Therefore, the cost of research can be calculated as follows:

Cost for the first 5 months = $100,000
Cost for the subsequent months = $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000

Total cost of research = Cost for the first 5 months + Cost for the subsequent months
Total cost of research = $100,000 + ($150,000 * 5)
Total cost of research = $100,000 + $750,000
Total cost of research = $850,000

Error in parse_target_model_output: Input: Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. She was getting hungrier so she tripled the number of slices she currently has. She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. What number of cake slices remained on the plate?

Your answer: 12

<E>First, Mara added 3 slices to the initial 2, making a total of 5 slices. Then, she tripled this amount to get 15 slices. After eating 2 slices, there were 13 left. Finally, when her friend stole 5 slices, there were 8 slices left on the plate.</E>

Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>First, we calculate the number of boys at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 2 * 60 = 120 boys. 
Next, we find the total number of students at the school by adding the number of boys and girls: 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students. 
Given that there are 5 students to every teacher, we divide the total number of students by 5 to find the number of teachers: 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.</E>

Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>First, calculate the total number of basketball cards by multiplying the number of decks (6) by the number of cards in each deck (25): 6 * 25 = 150 cards.
Next, calculate the total number of baseball cards by multiplying the number of boxes (5) by the number of cards in each box (40): 5 * 40 = 200 cards.
Add the total number of basketball and baseball cards: 150 + 200 = 350 cards.
Since Miss Maria kept 50 cards for herself, subtract that from the total: 350 - 50 = 300 cards given to students.
Finally, divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student received (10) to find the number of students: 300 / 10 = 30 students.
Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students.</E>

Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>First, let's determine the total number of students who do have desktop computers at home. If three-fourths of the students have desktop computers, then one-fourth of the students do not. Since 20 students do not have desktop computers, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of students:
1/4 * Total number of students = 20
Total number of students = 20 * 4
Total number of students = 80
Therefore, there are 80 students at that grade level.</E>

Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>First, let's calculate the total time spent on meditation. Charisma meditates twice a day for a total of 30 minutes. Since there are 7 days in a week, she spends 30 x 7 = 210 minutes on meditation per week. In 4 weeks, she would spend 210 x 4 = 840 minutes on meditation. 

Next, let's calculate the total time spent on yoga practice. Charisma practices 1 hour of yoga 5 days a week, which is 60 minutes per day. In 4 weeks, she would spend 60 x 5 x 4 = 1200 minutes on yoga practice. 

Finally, to find the total time spent on meditation/yoga practice, we add the time spent on meditation and yoga together: 840 + 1200 = 2040 minutes.

So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent 2040 minutes (or 34 hours) on meditation/yoga practice. </E>
