Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>First, let's find out how much water was pumped into the tank on the first day.
Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 18000 * 1/4 = 4500 gallons.
Ms. B then pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons.

Then, let's calculate how much water was pumped into the tank on the second day.
Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons.
Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 3375 * 1/3 = 1125 gallons.

Now, let's sum up the total amount of water pumped on both days.
4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons.

Finally, to find out how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity.
18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons remaining for the tank to be full.</E>

Error in evaluating: 30 vs 4<E> 

To find the total cost, we first need to calculate the individual costs of adult tickets, child tickets, and popcorns.

Let's assume the cost of an adult ticket is $10, and Miss Maria bought 5 adult tickets. 
Total cost of adult tickets = 10 x 5 = $50

Next, let's assume the cost of a child ticket is $5, and Miss Maria bought 8 child tickets.
Total cost of child tickets = 5 x 8 = $40

Lastly, let's assume the cost of a popcorn is $3 each, and Miss Maria bought 10 popcorns.
Total cost of popcorns = 3 x 10 = $30

Now, to find the total cost, we add the individual costs together:
Total cost = 50 (adult tickets) + 40 (child tickets) + 30 (popcorns) = $120

So, the total cost for all the tickets and popcorns is $120.

Error in parse_target_model_output: <E>Let's denote the number of apples Jamal has as A and the number of bananas as B. 
Given that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and 52 apples in total, we can write the equation: A + 8 = 52
This simplifies to A = 52 - 8 = 44.
We also know that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so B = 0.5 * A = 0.5 * 44 = 22.
Finally, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so B = A + 4.
Substitute the value of B from the second equation into the third equation: 22 = 44 + 4, which is incorrect.
There seems to be inconsistency or error in the input provided. Would you like to try again or ask something else?
